# Textbox

Generates a text box of one or more lines, with an optional border.
If a colour is not declared for text, background or the border then it
will not be generated.
It has the following fields:

- `text` - an array of strings, the font size is generated so the text fills the space, where multiple lines of
text are used. The smallest font of the multiple lines is used.
- `borderColor` - is the colour of the border
- `borderSize` - the size of the border as a percentage of the height or width (whichever is smaller).
The maximum value is 50 (%)
- `font` - the font to be used, it can be an in built font of title, body, pixel or header. Or it can be
the path to a local or web file.
- `backgroundColor` - the colour of the background.
- `textColor` - the colour of the text.
- `fillType` - the fill of the text in the textbox, it can be full or relaxed.
- `xAlignment` - the text alignment in the x direction, it can be left, right or middle.
- `yAlignment` - the text alignment in the y direction, it can be top, bottom or middle.
